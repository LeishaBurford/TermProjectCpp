We note that Deck, DiscardPile, TradeArea,Hand and Chain are all containers holding cards.

Deck will initially hold all the cards which will have to be shuffled to produce a randomized order, then players' hands are dealt and during game play players draw cards from the Deck
	 extend a std::vector

DiscardPile 
	 extend a std::vector will work fine, but here we can use simple aggregation

TradeArea
	 extend a std::vector

Hand players have to keep their hand in order and the first card drawn is the first card played.
	Therefore, we can use a std::vector to remove at an arbitrary location with a std::queue adapter

Chain
	extend a std::vector
	will hold the cards by pointer in a std::vector<GemName*>.

Card will be abstract base class, eight different gemstones will be derived from it. All containers hold cards through the base type. slicing will occur
we will delete the copy constructor and assignment operator in Card

CardFactory generates all cards
